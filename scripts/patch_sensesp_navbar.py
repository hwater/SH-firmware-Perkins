"""PlatformIO pre-build patch: add a "Dash" item to the SensESP web-UI navbar.

The SensESP navbar is built from GET /api/routes, whose route list is hardcoded
in the library (sensesp/net/web/base_command_handler.cpp) with no app-level hook,
and SensESP registers that handler before our setup() code runs, so it cannot be
overridden from the sketch. This pre-build script injects one extra route into
the /api/routes JSON so a "Dash" entry appears in the navbar linking to our
custom /dash dashboard.

Two important details:
  * The entry is added to the JSON response only, NOT to the `routes` vector that
    the same function later uses to register SPA catch-all handlers. That keeps
    our real GET /dash handler from being shadowed by an index.html handler.
  * The href is the RELATIVE path "dash" (no leading slash). SensESP's frontend
    uses preact-router, whose click interceptor only hijacks links whose href
    starts with "/". A relative href therefore performs a normal full-page
    navigation, which resolves to /dash on the current origin and loads our page.

The patch is idempotent and re-applies on every build, so it survives library
re-installs / updates (which would otherwise wipe a manual edit in .pio/libdeps).
